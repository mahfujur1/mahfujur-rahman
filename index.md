### Biography
I am a professor with the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) (SCSE, UESTC), leanding the [Data Intelligence Group (DIG)](https://dig.uestc.cn/).

Previously, I was working with [Prof. Luc Van Gool](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/members/get_member.cgi?lang=en&id=1) as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/en/), Switzerland. I obtained my PhD degree under the supervision of [Prof. Dong Xu](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/dong.xu.php) from NTU on 2015. I also worked closely with [Prof. Ivor Wai-Hung Tsang](http://www.uts.edu.au/staff/ivor.tsang) during my PhD.
